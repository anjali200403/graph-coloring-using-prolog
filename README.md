# Graph Coloring with Prolog

This repository contains a Prolog implementation for solving the graph coloring problem. The objective is to color the nodes of a graph in such a way that no two adjacent nodes have the same color.

## Introduction

Graph coloring is a fundamental problem in computer science and mathematics. This Prolog implementation utilizes a backtracking algorithm to find a valid coloring for a given graph. It explores different color assignments for each node while ensuring that adjacent nodes have distinct colors.
